# Greetings ! :wave:
I'm Ambroise, I'm a french Web Developper and this is my GitHub :)

## About myself
### Web Development :computer:
This is my first activity. I'm studying since May 15th, 2023.
I'm starting to have solid bases in the Front End part and now currently learning Back End in parallel.

### My Coding Passion :sunglasses:
I love to create some little things like a discord bot, or modding my favourite games :eyes:.
I created a general bot in my private discord server (repo on github soon), and some
mods on various games like Curious Expedition, Civ 6 or Minecraft for fun.
